== Site to scrape

This website is built to test the scraping time between CSS selectors and XPath.

If you would like to test this out on your own, you will have to do the following:
 - `bundle install` to make sure you have all the required gems installed
 - `rake db:create && rake db:migrate` to set up the database
 - `rake db:seed` to seed the database with 1000 fake products
 - `rails s` to run the server on localhost:3000
 - `rake benchmark:run_benchmark` to run the test
